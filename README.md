# APi-reg
Image registration processes for all-purpose images (non-specific and non-specialized)

# Introduction
This repo is the result of a research for the Information Design course at [UNIRSM](https://design.unirsm.sm/) (2024), in collaboration with the [Visual Contagions project](https://www.unige.ch/visualcontagions/) from the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/).
The goal of the research is to find the best ways and practices to automatically register (align) a stack of images that contain the same picture, like the following:
//img placeholder
> Initially, the goal was to create a visualization tool that allowed to perceive the variation in space and time of the layouts containing different images of the same artwork in context (eg.different scans of the Monnalisa from different publications), from the Visual Contagions artwork cluster. Since the initial prompt, the interest regarding the technological aspects about the automation of the process took the priority over the tool itself, shifting the project to this research.

# Requirements
* Image files of the same format and size (although not necessary for all the solutions, it's a good way to be sure to be able to experiment with different tools)

# Hardware used for the tests:
MSI GP76 Leopard
* Intel core i7-11800H (8 core, 16 threads)
* NVidia RTX 3070 8gb
* 16gb RAM

ASUS ROG GL502VM
* Intel core i7-7700 (4 cores, 8 threads)
* NVidia GTX 1060 6gb
* 40gb RAM
